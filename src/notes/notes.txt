Id auth server

request public and private keys for every service connected to it

uses the key provider to create its keys

has own connection to the key service 

for other servers connecting directly with the key service and requesting keys a random secret key is generated 
-on first use this secret is signed using the  requesting servers stored public key assigned to that serverice by key server

the requesting server then decrypts the data using private key and sends it back to verify secret is accurate and returns it to key server encrypted by the key servers public key

the key serever decrypts the req matches the hashed secret key and then creates new key pair
server encrypts private key with hashed secret key and stores it and public key

key server encrypts with req public key and sends un encrypted keys and hash of secret key to be used to for session iding

same type of process to get app secrets
